## 👨‍💻About Me
I'm passionate about Full-Stack development, Machine Learning, and the infamous Blockchain technology. <br><br>
I know for a fact that it is not posssible to excel in all these areas at once, <br> 
so I am currently focusing on Front-End because that's the best <br>
place for me to start because I can visually see what I'm building. <br>

## 🛠️ Programming Languages
Although I could add more logos of languages to make this section <br>
look appealing to you, I would be lying to myself cause I don't know them. <br><br>
Below are some of the languages, and libraries/frameworks that I am proficient in.
